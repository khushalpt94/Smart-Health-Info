# Smart-Health-Info
This is a final project for the course 'Smart Health Info' on detecting diagnostics using Machine Learning Algorithms.
To run the code, the python notebook can be used to run and the dataset - mtsamples.csv can be used.
Also, the glove file - glove.6B.100d.txt can be downloaded from the link (too big to upload): https://www.kaggle.com/anindya2906/glove6b/download or http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
The project report is uploaded as well for reference.
